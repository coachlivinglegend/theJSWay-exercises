/*
Character inventory
Improve the example RPG to add character inventory management according to the following rules:

A character's inventory contains a number of gold and a number of keys.

Each character begins with 10 gold and 1 key.

The character description must show the inventory state.

When a character slays another character, the victim's inventory goes to its vanquisher.

Here's the expected execution result.

    this.health = health;
